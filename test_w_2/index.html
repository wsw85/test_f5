            <p>How to combine two separate unrelated Git repositories into one with single history timeline.</p>
            <p>Just adding a quick note on thisâ€¦</p>
            <p>I had a project that started off as itâ€™s own project but it ended up needing to go into an already existing project, so I thought ok add it as a new branch on the existing project with <code>git remote add origin</code> then push the changes up to the origin then all is well with the world.</p>
            <p>That was until I tried to compare the branchesâ€¦</p>
            <p><img src="img/screen-1.png" alt="screen-1"></p>
            <p>There isnâ€™t anything to compare? Bit misleading there as there is but the commit histories are different.</p>
            <p>How do you get around it, well the first Google result was a bit sparse with the details but then I found this which was more helpful.</p>
            <p>I needed to merge the disparate branches which is now disabled by default in git but can be enabled with the <code>--allow-unrelated-histories</code> flag.</p>
            <p><code>git merge origin use-ts-bot --allow-unrelated-histories</code></p>
            <p>This brought up, understandably, a few conflicts with the branch I wanted to merge with the origin.</p>
            <p><code>Auto-merging package.json
                CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in package.json
                Auto-merging package-lock.json
                CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in package-lock.json
                Auto-merging README.md
                CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md
                Auto-merging .gitignore
                CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in .gitignore
                Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></p>
            <p>To get around this I just took the latest version of the <code>use-ts-bot</code> branch from my GitHub account and then and used that in place of the <code>origin</code> conflicts as what Iâ€™m working on will ultimately replace the master branch, so it was just a copy pasta into my VSCode then recommit the changes files.</p>
            <p>Phew! I now have a branch I can compare with the master that I will one day make a PR for ðŸ˜…</p>
